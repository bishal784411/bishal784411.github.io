title: "Weekend Task: Building a Personalized Portfolio"
---

I hope you are doing well! I am assigning you a task that needs to be completed over the weekend and submitted by **6 PM on Sunday**.

### Task Overview

1. **Fork the Repository**  
   Start by forking the [online-cv repository](https://github.com/sharu725/online-cv) to your GitHub account.

2. **Clone and Build**  
   Clone the repository to your local machine and begin building your personalized portfolio site.

3. **Personalize the Portfolio**  
   Modify the portfolio by adding your own information. Remove any sections that you find unnecessary or irrelevant. I'm keen to see how you handle the removal of content.

4. **Add Blog Feature**  
   Implement a blog feature on your site. Include a button below the profile image that links to a blog listing page.

5. **PDF CV Download**  
   Add a button that allows visitors to download a PDF version of your CV. A simple download will be sufficient for now.

6. **Project Listing Page**  
   Create a separate page dedicated to listing all your projects.

7. **Theme Modification**  
   Modify the theme by moving the right-hand column to the left side. Ensure that the site remains visually appealing on mobile devices.

### Compensation and Guidance

You will receive **5,000 NPR** within the week following submission. After reviewing your work with my team, I will provide additional instructions.

Feel free to reach out via WhatsApp at **+610402002441** if you encounter any issues or need assistance during the weekend. I'll be available to supervise and guide you.

### Final Thoughts

Remember, there's no need to push yourself to the point of burnout. Stay focused, think clearly, and do your best within your limits. It's not about doing everything but giving your full effort to the tasks you undertake. Don't hesitate to ask for help; there are no stupid questions. Effective communication will be crucial in your evaluation, so stay engaged and express yourself clearly.

**All the best!**
